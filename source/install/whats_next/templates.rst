Templates
=========

Pages need templates. They contains the content written in the back-office and set the style.

	:alt: Template
	:align: center

The template is chosen when adding or modifying a page.

	:alt: Choose a template
	:align: center

New templates can be added. Templates are embedded in the applications. To add a template, one must therefore add an application (with the :doc:`applications manager <applications>`).
